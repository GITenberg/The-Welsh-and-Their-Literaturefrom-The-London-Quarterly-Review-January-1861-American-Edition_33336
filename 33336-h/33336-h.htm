20</span>Art. II.&mdash;<i>The Sleeping Bard</i>; <i>or Visions
of the World</i>, <i>Death</i>, <i>and Hell</i>.&nbsp; By Elis
Wyn.&nbsp; Translated from the Cambrian British by George
Borrow.&nbsp; London, 1860.</p>
<p>The Welsh style themselves Cymry or Cumry, a word which, in
their language, means a number of people associated together. <a
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a>&nbsp; They were the second mass of
population which moved from Asia into Europe.&nbsp; They followed
and pushed forward the Gael or Gauls; were themselves impelled
onward by the Slowaks or Sclavonians, who were themselves hunted,
goaded, and pestered by a wild, waspish race of people, whom, for
want of a better name, we will call Tatars or Tartars.&nbsp; The
Cymry have left their name behind them in various regions far
eastward of the one where they now sojourn.&nbsp; The most
easterly countries which still bear their name, or modifications
thereof, are Cambia, &lsquo;which is two dayes journey from the
head of the great river Bruapo,&rsquo; and the Cryme or
Crimea.&nbsp; In those parts, and &lsquo;where Constantinople now
is,&rsquo; they tarried a considerable time, and increased and
multiplied marvellously: and it was whilst tarrying in those
regions, which they called collectively Gwlad yr Haf, or the
summer country, that an extraordinary man was born amongst them,
who was called by Greeks and Romans, hundreds of years after his
death, Hesus, but whom the Cymry called, and still do call, Hu or
Hee, with the surname of Cadarn, or the Mighty.&nbsp; This Hu or
Hesus taught his countrymen the use of the plough, and to a
certain extent civilized them.&nbsp; Finding eventually that the
summer country was becoming over-populated, he placed himself at
the head of a vast multitude and set off towards the west.&nbsp;
Hu and his people fought or negotiated their way through various
countries possessed by the Gael, till they came to the shore of
the sea which separates the great isle of the west from the
continent.&nbsp; Hearing that it was only thinly peopled they
determined to pass over to it; and put their determination into
execution, crossing &lsquo;the hazy sea,&rsquo; at present termed
the German Ocean, in boats made of wicker work and skins, similar
to but larger than the coracles which the Cymry always carried
with them in their long expeditions.</p>
<p>This great island was called Alban, Albyn, or Albion.&nbsp;
Alban is a Gaelic or Gaulic word, signifying properly a
hill-region.&nbsp; It is to be found under various modifications
in different parts of the world, but only where the Gaulic race
have at some time sojourned.&nbsp; The word Afghan is merely a
modification of Alban, or Alpan; so is Armenia; so is Alp; so is
of course Albania.&nbsp; The term was given to the island simply
because the cliffs which fronted the continent, where the sea
between the two lands was narrowest, were very high and
towering.&nbsp; The island at the time of the arrival of the
Cymry had, as has already been intimated, a scanty
population.&nbsp; This population consisted of Gael or Gauls, a
people of cognate race to the Cymry, and speaking a language much
the same as theirs, differing from it, however, in some
respects.&nbsp; Hu and his people took possession of the best
parts of the island, either driving the few Gaels to other
districts or admitting them to their confederacy.&nbsp; As the
country was in a very wild state, much overgrown with forests in
which bears and wolves wandered, and abounding with deep stagnant
pools, which <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>were the haunts of the avanc or
crocodile, Hu forthwith set about clearing it of some of its
horrors, and making it more fit to be the abiding place of
civilized beings.&nbsp; He made his people cut down woods and
forests, and destroy, as far as was possible, wild beasts and
crocodiles.&nbsp; He himself went to a gloomy pool, the haunt of
the king of the efync, baited a huge hook attached to a cable,
filing it into the pool, and when the monster had gorged the
snare drew him out by means of certain gigantic oxen, <a
name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a> which he had tamed to the plough, and
burnt his horrid, wet, scaly carcass on a fire.&nbsp; He then
caused enclosures to be made, fields to be ploughed and sown,
pleasant wooden houses to be built, bees to be sheltered and
encouraged, and schools to be erected where song and music were
taught.&nbsp; O, a truly great man was Hu Gadarn! though a
warrior, he preferred the sickle and pruning-hook to the sword,
and the sound of the song and lute to the hoarse blast of the
buffalo&rsquo;s horn:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">The mighty Hu with mead would pay<br />
The bard for his melodious lay;<br />
The Emperor of land and sea<br />
And of all livings things was he. <a name="citation21b"></a><a
href="#footnote21b" class="citation">[21b]</a></p>
<p>For many years after the death of Hu the Cymry retrograded
instead of advancing in civilization; they ceased to be a united
people; plunder and devastation were of daily occurrence among
them; every one did as he pleased, as far as in his power lay;
there was no law, but the law of the strongest; and no justice,
save that which was obtained from clemency and courtesy.&nbsp; At
length one Prydain arose, who, either from ambition or a nobler
motive, determined to introduce a system of government amongst
them.&nbsp; By strength of arm and character he induced the Cymry
of the lower country to acknowledge him for their head, and to
obey certain laws which he enacted for the regulation of
conduct.&nbsp; But neither his sovereignty nor his laws were
regarded by the Cymry of the hilly regions.&nbsp; Prydain was the
first king amongst the Cymry; and from his time the island was
called Britain, which is a modification of his name, and the
inhabitants Britons.&nbsp; The independent Cymry, however,
disdained to call themselves or their districts after him, but
still styled themselves Cymry, and their districts Cumrie-land
and Cumberland; whilst the Gael of the North, who never submitted
to his sway, and who knew little about him, still called
themselves Gael, and their country Caledon and Alban.</p>
<p>Various kings succeeded Prydain, during whose reigns the
Britons continued in much the same state as that in which he had
left them; on the coming of one Dyfnwal Moelmud, however, to the
throne, a mighty improvement was effected in their
condition.&nbsp; This prince was the great lawgiver of the
Britons, and the greatest benefactor which the race had known
since the days of Hu Gadarn.&nbsp; Tradition differs as to his
exact origin, but there is ground for believing that he was the
chief of a Cornish tribe, and that he was elected to the throne
on account of his wisdom and virtue.&nbsp; He gave a regular
system of laws and a constitution to the kingdom, and appointed
magistrates in every place, whose duty it was to administer
justice without respect of persons in all disputes, and whenever
the law had been violated.&nbsp; This great and good man is
believed to have lived about 400 years before the Christian
era.</p>
<p>After the Cymric or British race had been established in the
island about 1300 years, they were invaded by the Romans, under
Julius C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; The king, who at that time <!-- page
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>ruled
in Britain, was called Caswallon; he was a great warrior and much
beloved by his subjects.&nbsp; In him and his Britons the Romans
found their match and more, for after a month&rsquo;s hard
fighting and skirmishing, they were compelled to betake
themselves to Gaul, the country from which they had come.</p>
<p>Mighty was the triumph in Britain, says an old chronicler, on
the retreat of the redoubted foe; and Caswallon gave a grand
festival at Caer Lud, or London, which was reckoned in after
times one of the three grand festivals of Britain.&nbsp; A grand
festival indeed it must have been, if, as an ancient bard
says,</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Full twenty thousand beeves and deer<br
/>
Were slain to find the guests with cheer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Britain was not subdued by the Romans till the time of
Claudius C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; When conquered it was still permitted
to possess a king of its own, on condition that he should
acknowledge the authority of Rome, and pay tribute to her.&nbsp;
The first king in the world to confess the faith of Christ was a
British king, tributary to Rome.&nbsp; This king, whose name was
Lles ap Coel, made his confession as early as the year 160.&nbsp;
The Christian faith is supposed by some to have been first
preached in Britain by Joseph of Arimathea; by others, by St.
Paul himself.&nbsp; After remaining several centuries under the
sway of Rome, the Britons again became independent, the Roman
legions being withdrawn from the island for the defence of their
own country, threatened by barbarian hordes.&nbsp; They did not,
however, enjoy their independence long; a ferocious race, of
mysterious origin, whom they called Gwyddelian Fichti, invaded
them, and filled their country with horror and devastation.&nbsp;
Unable to offer any effectual opposition to these invaders, they
called to their assistance, from the neighbourhood of the mouth
of the Elbe, the Saxons or <i>men of the knives</i>, a bold and
adventurous, but treacherous and bloody people, who at first
fought stoutly for them, but soon turned against them, and
eventually all but extirpated them from Southern
Britain:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A serpent that
coils,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with fury boils,<br />
From Germany coming with arm&rsquo;d wings spread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall subdue and enthral<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The broad Britain all<br />
From the Lochlin ocean to Severn&rsquo;s bed;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And British men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall be captives then<br />
To strangers from Saxonia&rsquo;s strand;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall praise their God, and hold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their language, as of old,<br />
But except wild Wales they shall lose their land.&rsquo; <a
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: right" class="poetry"><i>Taliesin</i>.</p>
<p>Yes; the Cymric or British race were dispossessed of Britain
with the exception of that part which they still emphatically
call Cumrie, but which by other people is called Wales.&nbsp;
There they remained independent for a long time, governed by
their own princes; and there, though now under the sway of
England, they still preserve their venerable language, the oldest
in the world, with perhaps the exception of the Gaulic or Irish,
with which it is closely connected.&nbsp; Wales is not a Cymric
but a Saxon or Teutonic word, bestowed on the land of the Cymry
by the seed of Hengist.&nbsp; Like the Gaelic word Alban, it
means a hilly or mountainous region, and is connected with wall,
wold, and wood.&nbsp; The Germans, from very early times, have
called the Cymry Welsh or Waldenses, and the country where they
happened to be, Welschland.&nbsp; They still apply to Italy the
name of Welschland, a name bestowed upon it by their ancestors,
because it was originally principally peopled by the Cymry, whom
the Germans called Welsh from the circumstance of their
inhabiting some mountainous or forest country in the far East,
when they first came in contact with them.</p>
<p>We now proceed to give some account of the literature of the
Cymry.&nbsp; We commence with their poetry, and from a very early
period, quoting from a Cymric Triad:&mdash;&lsquo;These are the
three artificers of poetry and record amongst the nation of the
Cymry: Gwyddon Ganhebon, who first in the world invented vocal
song; and Hu the Mighty, who first invented the means of
recording and preserving vocal song; and Tydan, the father of the
muse, who first gave rules to vocal song and a system to
recording.&nbsp; From what these three men effected Bards and
Bardism were derived; the dignities and customs pertaining to
which were arranged systematically by the three original bards,
Plenydd, Alon, and Gwbon.&rsquo;&nbsp; Three ranks or orders
constituted what was called barddas, or bardism; that of bard or
poet, that of ovydd or philosopher, and that of druid or
instructor.&nbsp; The motto of this institution
was&mdash;&lsquo;Y Gwir yn erbyn y byd,&rsquo; or The Truth
against the world; from which it would appear that bardism was
instituted for the purpose of propagating truth.&nbsp; Bardism,
or as it is generally though improperly styled, druidism, was the
fount of instruction, moral and religious, in Britain and in
Gaul.&nbsp; The vehicle by which instruction, or, as it was
probably termed, truth, was propagated, was poetry.&nbsp; The
bard wrought the philosophy of the ovydd into song, and the druid
or instructor, who was also minister of such religion as the
Celts and Cymry possessed, <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>whatever that
was, communicated to his pupils the result of the labours of the
bard and ovydd.&nbsp; The Druidical verses then probably
constituted the most ancient poetry of Britain.&nbsp; These
verses were communicated orally, and were never written down
whilst bardism or druidism lasted, though the bards and druids at
a very early period were acquainted with the use of
letters.&nbsp; Whether any genuine bardic poetry has been
preserved, it is impossible to say; it is the opinion, however,
of Cymric scholars of reputation, that certain ancient strains
which the Welsh possess, which are composed in a measure called
Englyn milwr, are either druidical strains or imitations of
such.&nbsp; Each of these compositions is in three lines; the
entire pith however of the triplet, generally consisting of a
moral adage or a piece of wholesome advice, lies in the third
line, the two first being composed of trivial and unconnected
expressions.&nbsp; Many of these stanzas are called the stanzas
of &lsquo;The Mountain Snow,&rsquo; from the circumstance of
their commencing with &lsquo;Eiry Mynydd,&rsquo; which has that
signification.&nbsp; The three lines rhyme together at their
terminations; and a species of alliteration is observable
throughout.&nbsp; A word or two here on Cymric rhyme and
measures.</p>
<p>In Welsh poetry rhyme is found in a twofold shape: there is
alliteration, that is rhyme produced by the same letters
following each other at certain distances in the body of the
line, then there is the common rhyme, produced by two or more
lines terminating with the same letters.&nbsp; In the older Welsh
poetry, by which we mean that composed before the termination of
the first millennium, both rhyme and alliteration are employed,
but in a less remarkable manner than in the bardic effusions of
comparatively modern times.&nbsp; The extent to which the bards
of the middle ages, and those of one or two subsequent centuries,
carried rhyme and alliteration seems marvellous to the English
versifier.&nbsp; We English think we have accomplished a great
feat in rhyme when we have made three lines consonant in their
terminations; but Dafydd Benfras, or David of the Thick Head,
would make fifty lines rhyme together, and not think that he had
accomplished anything remarkable in rhyming either.&nbsp; Our
English alliterative triumph is the following line, composed by a
young lady in the year 1800, on the occasion of a gentleman of
the name of Lee planting a lane with lilacs:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Let lovely lilacs line Lee&rsquo;s
lonely lane!&rsquo;</p>
<p>in which not only every word, but every syllable commences
with the same letter&mdash;<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>But what is this English alliterative triumph of the young
lady compared with the Welsh alliterative triumph of Dafydd
Nanmawr, who wrote a poem of twelve lines, every syllable of
which commences with the letter g, with the exception of the
last, which begins with n?</p>
<p>The earliest Cymric or British metre seems to have been a
triban or triplet, in each line of which there were in general
six syllables.&nbsp; The bards of the sixth, seventh, and several
succeeding centuries used this metre, and likewise others,
invented by themselves, in which the lines are of various
length.&nbsp; There was no regular system of prosody till the
year 1120, when one was established under the auspices of Grufydd
ap Cynan, prince of Gwynedd.&nbsp; This Ap Cynan, who, though of
Welsh origin, was born in Dublin, and educated at the Danish
Irish court, was passionately fond of poetry, and was not only
well acquainted with that of the British bards, but with the
strains of the Icelandic skalds and Irish fileas.&nbsp; Shortly
after his accession to the throne of Gwynedd, of which he was the
rightful heir, he proclaimed an eisteddfod, or poetical
sessions.&nbsp; At this eisteddfod, which was numerously attended
by poets of various nations, a system of prosody was drawn up by
competent persons, at his instigation, for the use of the Welsh,
and established by his authority.&nbsp; This system, in which
Cymric, Icelandic, and Irish forms of verse are blended and
amalgamated, has with a few unimportant variations maintained its
ground to the present time.&nbsp; It contains three primary
measures, termed respectively, englyn, cywydd, and awdl.&nbsp; Of
the englyn, there are five kinds; of the cywydd, four; and of the
awdl, fifteen.&nbsp; Each particular species of englyn, cywydd,
and awdl has its appropriate name, which it is needless to give
here.&nbsp; These three primary metres, with their modifications,
make together twenty-four measures, which embrace the whole
system of Welsh versification, in which, as somebody has
observed, each line, word, and letter, are so harmonized by
consonancy, chained so accurately, woven so closely and
correctly, that it is impossible to extract one word or even
letter without causing a hideous gap.&nbsp; Whoever has ventured
to compose out of these measures, since the time of their
establishment, has been considered by the Welsh scholar as
unworthy of the name of poet.</p>
<p>The earliest recorded poet of the Cymry, after the days of
Gwyddon Ganhebon and the other personages mentioned with him in
the triad, is Merddin, Beirdd Emrys Wledig, or Merddin, Bard of
Prince Emrys.&nbsp; He flourished about the middle of the fifth
century, the period when the Saxons arrived in Britain, <!-- page
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>under
the command of Hengist and Horsa.&nbsp; Besides poetry he was
skilled in mathematics, and is said by the Welsh to have been the
architect of Stonehenge.&nbsp; He has been surnamed Ambrosius,
which is the Latin modification of the name of his patron
Emrys.&nbsp; He is the Merddin, or Merlin, who has had to father
so many of the prophecies which since his death have been
produced.&nbsp; None of his poems are extant.</p>
<p>During the period which elapsed between the first coming of
the Saxons, and the expulsion of the British from the Southern
and Eastern parts of the island, lived Aneurin, Taliesin,
Llewarch Hen, and Merddin, surnamed Wyllt or the Wild, all
celebrated poets, the latter of whom has generally been
confounded with Merddin Ambrosius.&nbsp; Aneurin was a chief of
the Ottadinian Britons, and his principal poem is the one styled
Gododin, a word which probably means that which relates to the
Ottadini.&nbsp; It is descriptive of the battle of Cattraeth,
fought between the Britons and the Saxons, in which the former
were so completely worsted that only three, amongst whom was
Aneurin himself, escaped with their lives.&nbsp; The poem is
composed in lines remarkably short, consisting in general of only
six syllables.&nbsp; Aneurin was the Gildas of ecclesiastical
history, and the name of Gildas is merely a Saxon translation of
Aneurin, which signifies golden grove.&nbsp; Taliesin Ben Beirdd,
or Taliesin Prince of Bards, was a North Welshman, but was
educated at Llanreithin, in Glamorgan, under Catwg, celebrated
for his aphorisms, who kept a school of philosophy there.&nbsp;
He was called Prince of Bards because he excelled all his
contemporaries in the poetic art.&nbsp; Many of his pieces are
extant; amongst them is an awdl or ode, containing an abridgment
of the history of the world, in which there is a stanza with
regard to the destiny of the ancient Britons as sublime as it is
true:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Their Lord they shall praise,<br />
Their language they shall keep,<br />
Their land they shall lose<br />
Except wild Wales.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Llewarch Hen, or Llewarch the aged, was a prince of
Cumberland.&nbsp; Driven from his domain by the Saxons, he sought
a refuge at the place which is now called Shrewsbury, and
subsequently on the shore of the lake of Bala, a beautiful sheet
of water in Merionethshire, overlooked on the south by the great
mountain Arran.&nbsp; There he died at the age of one hundred and
fifty years.&nbsp; His poems consist chiefly of elegies on his
sons, twenty-four in number, all of whom perished in battle, and
on his slaughtered friends.&nbsp; They are composed in triplets,
and abound with simplicity and pathos.&nbsp; Myrddin Wyllt, or
Myrddin the Wild, was a Briton of the Scottish border.&nbsp;
Having killed the son of his sister, he was so stung with remorse
that he determined to renounce the society of men, and
accordingly retired to a forest in Scotland, called Celydon,
where he was frequently seized with howling madness.&nbsp; Owing
to his sylvan life and his attacks of lunacy, he was called
Merddyn Wyllt, or the Wild.&nbsp; He composed poetry in his lucid
intervals.&nbsp; Six of his pieces have been preserved: they are
chiefly on historical subjects.&nbsp; The most remarkable of them
is an address to his pig, in which he tells the woes and
disasters which are to happen to Britain: it consists of
twenty-five stanzas or sections.&nbsp; In all of them a kind of
alliteration is observable, and in each, with one or two
exceptions, the first line rhymes with all the rest.&nbsp; Each
commences with &lsquo;Oian a phorchellan&rsquo;&mdash;listen,
little porker!&nbsp; The commencement of one of these stanzas
might be used in these lowering days by many a grey-headed yeoman
to his best friend:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oian a phorchellan: mawr eryssi<br />
A fydd ym Mhrydan, ac nim dorbi.</p>
<p class="poetry">Listen, little porker! mighty wonders<br />
Shall occur in Britain, which shall not con me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Many and great poets flourished in the times of the Welsh
princes: the three greatest were Meilyr, Gwalchmai, and Dafydd
Benfras.&nbsp; Meilyr was bard of Gruffudd ap Cynan, prince of
Gwynedd or North Wales, who died in 1137.&nbsp; He sang the
praises of his master, who was a celebrated warrior and a
bountiful patron of the muse, in whose time and under whose
sanction those forms of composition, generally called the twenty
four measures, were invented and promulgated.&nbsp; Gwalchmai
lived in the time of Owain, prince of Gwynedd, about whom he sang
a piece which is to a certain extent known to the English public
by a paraphrase made by Gray, which bears the title of &lsquo;The
Triumphs of Owain.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dafydd Benfras was domestic bard
of Llywelyn ap Jorwerth, also prince of Gwynedd and titular king
of Wales, who flourished during the first half of the thirteenth
century.&nbsp; In one of his odes addressed to his patron, there
is an animated description of a battle won by Llywelyn over King
John:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Llywelyn of the potent hand oft
wrought<br />
Trouble upon the kings and consternation;<br />
When he with the Lloegrain monarch fought,<br />
Whose cry was &ldquo;Devastation!&rdquo;<br />
Forward impetuously his squadrons ran;<br />
Great was the tumult ere the shoot began;<br />
Proud was the hero of his reeking glaive,<br />
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>Dafydd ab Gwilym was born at Bro Gynan, in Cardiganshire, in
1293, about forty years after the whole of Wales had been
subjected to the sway of England.&nbsp; He was the Ovid of Wales,
the poet of love and nature.&nbsp; In his early years he was very
dissipated, but towards the latter part of his life became
religious.&nbsp; He died at the age of sixty-three, and was
buried within the precincts of the great monastery of Strata
Florida. <a name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a>&nbsp; Such was the power of his
genius, that the generality of the poets who succeeded him for
the next four hundred years were more or less his
imitators.&nbsp; Iolo Goch, or Red Julius, whose real name was
Llwyd, was the bard of Owen Glendower, and, amongst other pieces,
composed a graphic ode on his patron&rsquo;s mansion at Sycharth,
and the manner of life there:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Its likeness now I&rsquo;ll limn you

&rsquo;Tis water-girdled wide about;<br />

Reach&rsquo;d by a bridge the water o&rsquo;er;<br />

Each column&rsquo;s thick and firmly bas&rsquo;d,<br />
And upon each a loft is plac&rsquo;d;<br />
In those four lofts, which coupled stand,<br />
Repose at night the minstrel band.<br />
Four lofts they were in pristine state,<br />

<p>Iolo composed this ode two years before the great Welsh
insurrection, when he was more than a hundred years old.&nbsp; To
his own great grief he survived his patron, and all hopes of
Welsh independence.&nbsp; An englyn, which he composed a few days
before his death, commemorates the year of the rising of
Glendower, and also the year to which the chieftain
lived:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;One thousand four hundred, no less and
no more,<br />
Was the date of the rising of Owen Glendower;<br />
Till fifteen were added with courage ne&rsquo;er cold<br />
Liv&rsquo;d Owen, though latterly Owen was old.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Glendower died at the age of sixty-seven: Iolo, when he called
him old, was one hundred and eighteen.</p>
<p>Gwilym ap Ieuan Hen flourished about 1450.&nbsp; He was bard
to Griffith ap Nicholas, chieftain of Dinefor, in whose praise he
wrote an ode, commencing with lines to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Griffith ap Nicholas! who like thee<br
/>
For wealth and power and majesty?<br />
Which most abound&mdash;I cannot say&mdash;<br />
On either side of Towey gay,<br />
From hence to where it meets the brine,<br />
Trees or stately towers of thine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Griffith ap Nicholas was a powerful chieftain of South Wales,
something of a poet and a great patron of bards.&nbsp; Seeing
with regret that there was much dissension amongst the bardic
order, and that the rules of bardism were nearly forgotten, he
held a bardic congress at Carmarthen, with the view of reviving
bardic enthusiasm and re-establishing bardic discipline.&nbsp;
The result of this meeting&mdash;the only one of the kind which
had been held in Wales since the days of the Welsh
princes&mdash;to a certain extent corresponded with his
wish.&nbsp; In the wars of the Roses he sided with York, chiefly
out of hatred to Jasper Earl of Pembroke, half-brother of Henry
VI.&nbsp; He was mortally wounded at the battle of
Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross, which was gained for Edward IV. by a
desperate charge made by Griffith and his Welshmen at
Pembroke&rsquo;s Banner, when the rest of the Yorkists were
wavering.&nbsp; His last words were: &lsquo;Welcome death! since
honour and victorie makes for us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dafydd ab Edmund was born at Pwll Gwepra, in the parish of
Hanmer, in Flintshire.&nbsp; He was the most skilful versifier of
his time.&nbsp; He attended the Eisteddfod, or congress, at
Carmarthen, held under the auspices of Griffith ap Nicholas, and
not only carried off the prize, but induced the congress to
sanction certain alterations in the poetical canons of Gruffudd
ab Cynan, which he had very much at heart.&nbsp; There is a
tradition that Griffith ap Nicholas commenced the business of the
congress by the following question: &lsquo;What is the cause,
nature, and end of an Eisteddfod?&rsquo;&nbsp; No one appearing
ready with an answer, Griffith said: &lsquo;Let the little man in
the grey coat answer;&rsquo; whereupon Dafydd made the following
reply: &lsquo;To remember what has been&mdash;to think of what
is&mdash;and to judge about what shall be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lewis Glyn Cothi lived during the wars of the Roses.&nbsp; He
was bard to Jasper Earl of Pembroke, son of Owen Tudor and
Catharine of France, and brother uterine of Henry VI.&nbsp; He
followed his patron to the fatal battle of Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross
as a captain of foot.&nbsp; His pieces are mostly on the events
of his time, and are full of curious historical information.</p>
<p>Ieuan Deulwyn was bard and friend of Ryce ap Thomas, to whom
he addressed a remarkable ode in stanzas of four lines on the
principle of counter-change, by which any line in the quatrain
may begin it.&nbsp; His friend and patron Ryce ap Thomas was the
grandson of that Griffith ap Nicholas who perished at the battle
of Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross, fighting against Lancaster.&nbsp;
Ryce, however, when Richmond, the last hope of Lancaster, landed
at Milford Haven, joined him at the head of &lsquo;all the
Ryces,&rsquo; and was the main cause of his eventually winning
the crown.&nbsp; He was loaded with riches and honours by Henry
VII., and was an especial favourite with Henry VIII., who used to
call him Father Preecc, my trusty Welshman.&nbsp; He was a great
warrior, a consummate courtier, and a very wise man; for whatever
harm he might do to people, he never spoke ill of anybody.&nbsp;
His tomb, bearing the sculptured figures of himself and wife, may
be seen in the church of St. Peter, at Carmarthen.</p>
<p>Sion Tudor was born about the middle of the sixteenth
century.&nbsp; He had much wit and humour, but was very
satirical.&nbsp; He wrote a bitter epigram on London, in which
city, by the bye, he had been most unmercifully <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>fleeced.&nbsp; William Middleton was one of the sea
captains of Queen Elizabeth; he translated the Psalms into
several of the four-and-twenty measures whilst commanding a ship
of war in the West Indian seas.&nbsp; Twm Sion Cati lived in the
days of James I.: he was a sweet poet, but&mdash;start not,
gentle reader! a ferocious robber.&nbsp; His cave amidst the wild
hills between Tregaron and Brecknock is still pointed out by the
neighbouring rustics.&nbsp; In the middle of the seventeenth
century was produced a singular little piece, author unknown: it
is an englyn or epigram of four lines on a spider, all in
vowels:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;O&rsquo;i wiw wy i weu e
&acirc;,&mdash;o&rsquo;i au,<br />
O&rsquo;i wyau y weua;<br />
E wywa ei we&rsquo; aua,&rsquo;<br />
A&rsquo;i weuai yw ieuau ia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A proest, or kind of counterchange, was eventually added to it
by one Gronwy Owen, so that the Welsh now can say, what perhaps
no other nation can, that they have a poem of eight lines in
their language, in which there is not a single consonant.&nbsp;
It is however necessary to state, that in the Welsh language
there are seven vowels, both w and y being considered and sounded
as such.&nbsp; The two parts may be thus rendered into
English:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;From out its womb it weaves with care<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its web beneath the roof;<br />
Its wintry web it spreadeth there&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wires of ice its woof.</p>
<p class="poetry">And doth it weave against the wall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thin ropes of ice on high?<br />
And must its little liver all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wondrous stuff supply?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Huw Morris was born in the year 1622, and died in 1709, having
lived in six reigns.&nbsp; The place of his birth was Pont y
Meibion, in the valley of Ceiriog, in Denbighshire.&nbsp; He was
a writer of songs, carols, and elegies, and was generally termed
Eos Ceiriog, or the Nightingale of Ceiriog, a title which he
occasionally well deserved, for some of his pieces, especially
his elegies, are of great beauty and sweetness.&nbsp; Not
unfrequently, however, the title of Dylluan Ceiriog, or the Owl
of Ceiriog, would be far more applicable, for whenever he thought
fit he could screech and hoot most fearfully.&nbsp; He was a
loyalist, and some of his strains against the Roundheads are
fraught with the bitterest satire.&nbsp; His dirge on Oliver and
his men, composed shortly after Monk had declared for Charles
II., is a piece quite unique in its way.&nbsp; He lies buried in
the graveyard of the beautiful church of Llan Silien, in
Denbigshire.&nbsp; The stone which covers his remains is yet to
be seen just outside the southern wall, near the porch.&nbsp; The
last great poet of Wales was a little swarthy curate;&mdash;but
this child of immortality, for such he is, must not be disposed
of in half a dozen lines.&nbsp; The following account of him is
extracted from an unpublished work, called &lsquo;Wild
Wales,&rsquo; by the author of &lsquo;The Bible in
Spain&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Goronwy, or Gronwy, Owen was born in the
year 1722, at a place called Llanfair Mathafrn Eithaf, in
Anglesea.&nbsp; He was the eldest of three children.&nbsp; His
parents were peasants and so exceedingly poor that they were
unable to send him to school.&nbsp; Even, however, when an
unlettered child he gave indications that he was visited by the
awen or muse.&nbsp; At length the celebrated Lewis Morris
chancing to be at Llanfair, became acquainted with the boy, and,
struck with its natural talents, determined that he should have
all the benefit which education could bestow.&nbsp; He
accordingly, at his own expense, sent him to school at Beaumaris,
where he displayed a remarkable aptitude for the acquisition of
learning.&nbsp; He subsequently sent him to Jesus College,
Oxford, and supported him there whilst studying for the
Church.&nbsp; At Jesus, Gronwy distinguished himself as a Greek
and Latin scholar, and gave proofs of such poetical talent in his
native language that he was looked upon by his countrymen of that
Welsh college as the rising bard of the age.&nbsp; After
completing his collegiate course, he returned to Wales, where he
was ordained a minster of the Church in the year 1745.&nbsp; The
next seven years of his life were a series of cruel
disappointments and pecuniary embarrassments.&nbsp; The grand
wish of his heart was to obtain a curacy, and to settle down in
Wales.&nbsp; Certainly a very reasonable wish, for, to say
nothing of his being a great genius, he was eloquent, highly
learned, modest, meek, and of irreproachable morals; yet Gronwy
Owen could obtain no Welsh curacy, nor could his friend Lewis
Morris, though he exerted himself to the utmost, procure one for
him.&nbsp; It was true that he was told that he might go to
Llanfair, his native place, and officiate there at a time when
the curacy happened to be vacant, and thither he went, glad at
heart to get back amongst his old friends, who enthusiastically
welcomed him; yet scarcely had he been there three weeks when he
received notice from the chaplain of the Bishop of Bangor that he
must vacate Llanfair in order to make room for a Mr. John Ellis,
a young clergyman of large independent fortune, who was wishing
for a curacy under the Bishop of Bangor, Doctor Hutton.&nbsp; So
poor Gronwy, the eloquent, the learned, the meek, was obliged to
vacate the pulpit of his native place to make room for the rich
young clergyman, who wished to be within dining distance of the
palace of Bangor.&nbsp; Truly in this world the full shall be
crammed, and those who have little shall have the little which
they have taken away from them.&nbsp; Unable to obtain employment
in Wales, Gronwy sought for it in England, and after some time
procured the curacy of Oswestry, in Shropshire, where he married
a respectable young woman, who <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>eventually
brought him two sons and a daughter.&nbsp; From Oswestry he went
to Donnington, near Shrewsbury, where, under a certain Scotchman
named Douglas, who was an absentee, and who died Bishop of
Salisbury, he officiated as curate and master of a grammar school
for a stipend&mdash;always grudgingly and contumeliously
paid&mdash;of three-and-twenty pounds a year.&nbsp; From
Donnington he removed to Walton in Cheshire, where he lost his
daughter, who was carried off by a fever.&nbsp; His next removal
was to Northolt, a pleasant village in the neighbourhood of
London.&nbsp; He held none of his curacies long, either losing
them from the caprice of his principals, or being compelled to
resign them from the parsimony which they practised towards
him.&nbsp; In the year 1756 he was living in a garret in London,
vainly soliciting employment in his sacred calling, and
undergoing with his family the greatest privations.&nbsp; At
length his friend Lewis Morris, who had always assisted him to
the utmost of his ability, procured him the mastership of a
Government school at New Brunswick, in North America, with a
salary of three hundred pounds a year.&nbsp; Thither he went with
his wife and family, and there he died some time about the year
1780.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was the last of the great poets of Cambria, and with
the exception of Ab Gwilym, the greatest which she has
produced.&nbsp; His poems, which for a long time had circulated
through Wales in manuscript, were first printed in the year
1819.&nbsp; They are composed in the ancient bardic measures, and
were, with one exception, namely, an elegy on the death of his
benefactor, Lewis Morris, which was transmitted from the New
World, written before he had attained the age of
thirty-five.&nbsp; All his pieces are excellent, but his
master-work is decidedly the Cywydd y Farn, or Day of
Judgment.&nbsp; This poem, which is generally considered by the
Welsh as the brightest ornament of their ancient language, was
composed at Donnington, a small hamlet in Shropshire, on the
north-west spur of the Wrekin, at which place, as has been
already said, Gronwy toiled as schoolmaster and curate under
Douglas the Scot, for a stipend of three-and-twenty pounds a
year.&rsquo; <a name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"

</blockquote>
<p>The prose literature of Wales is by no means so extensive as
the poetical; it, however, comprises much that is valuable and
curious on historical, biographical, romantic and moral
subjects.&nbsp; The most ancient Welsh prose may probably be
found in certain brief compositions, called Triads, which are
said to be of Druidic origin.&nbsp; The Triad was used for the
commemoration of historical facts or the inculcation of moral
duties.&nbsp; It has its name because in it three events are
commemorated, or three persons mentioned, if it be historical;
three things or three actions recommended or denounced, if it be
moral.&nbsp; To give the reader at once a tolerable conception of
what the Triad is, we subjoin two or three specimens of this kind
of composition.&nbsp; We commence with the historical
Triad:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;These are the three pillars of the race of
the isle of Britain: First, Hu the Mighty, who conducted the
nation of the Cumry from the summer country to the island of
Britain (bringing them from the continent) across the hazy sea
(German Ocean).&nbsp; Second, Prydain, son of Aedd Mawr, the
founder of government and rule in the isle of Britain, before
whose time there was no such thing as justice except what was
obtained by courtesy, nor any law save that of the
strongest.&nbsp; Third, Dyfnwal Moelmud, who first reduced to a
system the laws, customs, and privileges of his country and
nation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The three intruding tribes into the island of Britain
are the following: First, the Corranians, who came from the
country of Pwyl.&nbsp; Second, the Gwyddelian (silvan, Irish)
Fichti (Picts), who came to Alban across the sea of Lochlin
(Northern Ocean), and who still exist in Alban by the shore of
the sea of Lochlin (from Inverness to Thursoe).&nbsp; Third, the
Saxons . . . &rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for the historical Triad: now for the moral.&nbsp; The
following are selected from a curious collection of admonitory
sayings, called the &lsquo;Triads of the Cumro, or
Welshman:&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Three things should a Cumro always bear in
mind lest he dishonour them: his father, his country, and his
name of Cumro.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are three things for which a Cumro should be
willing to die: his country, his good name, and the truth
wherever it be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Three things are highly disgraceful to a Cumro: to look
with one eye, to listen with one ear, and to defend with one
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Three things it especially behoves a Cumro to choose
from his own country: his king, his wife, and his
friend.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the Triads, the following are the principal prose works
of the Welsh:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Chronicle of the Kings of the Isle of
Britain;&rsquo; supposed to have been written by Tysilio, in the
seventh century.&nbsp; This work, or rather a Latin paraphrase of
it by Geoffrey of Monmouth, has supplied our early English
historians with materials for those parts of their works which
are devoted to the subject of ancient Britain.&nbsp; It brings
down British history to the year 660.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A continuation of the same to the year 1152, by
Caradawg of Llancarvan.&nbsp; It begins thus: &ldquo;In the year
of Christ 660, died Cadwallawn ab Cadfan, King of the Britons,
and Cadwaladr his son became king in his place; <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>and, after
ten years of peace, the great sickness, which is called the
Yellow Plague, came over the whole isle of Britain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Code of Howel Da;&rsquo; a book consisting
of laws, partly framed, partly compiled, by Howel Da, or the
Good, who began to reign in the year 940.&nbsp; It is divided
into three parts, and contains laws relating to the government of
the palace and the family of the prince, laws concerning private
property, and laws which relate to private rights and
privileges.&nbsp; It is a code which displays much acuteness,
good sense, and not a little oddity.&nbsp; Many of Howel&rsquo;s
laws prevailed in Wales as far down as the time of Henry VII.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Life or Biography of Gruffydd ap
Cynan.&rsquo;&nbsp; This Gruffydd, of whom we have had more than
once occasion to speak already, was born in Dublin about the year
1075.&nbsp; He was the son of Cynan, an expatriated prince of
Gwynedd, by Raguel, daughter of Anlaf or Olafr, Dano-Irish king
of Dublin and the fifth part of Ireland.&nbsp; After a series of
the strangest adventures he succeeded in regaining his
father&rsquo;s throne, on which he died after a glorious reign of
fifty years.&nbsp; He was the father of Owen Gwynedd, one of the
most warlike of the Welsh princes, and was grandsire of that
Madoc who, there is considerable reason for supposing, was the
first discoverer of the great land in the West.&nbsp; A truly
remarkable book is the one above mentioned, which narrates his
life.&nbsp; It does full justice to the subject, being written in
a style not unworthy of Snorre Sturlesen, or the man who wrote
the history of King Sverrer and the Birkebeiners, in the latter
part of the Heimskringla.&nbsp; It is a composition of the
fifteenth century, but the author is unknown.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Mabinogion, or Juvenile Diversions, a collection
of Cumric legends, in substance of unknown antiquity, but in the
dress in which they have been handed down to us scarcely older
than the fourteenth century.&nbsp; In interest they almost vie
with the &lsquo;Arabian Nights,&rsquo; with which, however, they
have nothing else in common, notwithstanding that all other
European tales&mdash;those of Russia not excepted&mdash;are
evidently modifications of, or derived from the same source as
the Arabian stories.&nbsp; Of these Cumric legends two
translations exist: the first, which was never published, made
towards the concluding part of the last century by William Owen,
who eventually assumed the name of Owen Pugh, the writer of the
immortal Welsh and English Dictionary, and the translator into
Welsh of &lsquo;Paradise Lost;&rsquo; the second by the fair and
talented Lady Charlotte Guest, which first made these strange,
glorious stories known to England and all the world.</p>
<p>The sixth and last grand prose work of the Welsh is the
&lsquo;Sleeping Bard,&rsquo; a moral allegory, written about the
beginning of the last century by Elis Wyn, a High-Church Welsh
clergyman, a translation of which, by George Borrow, is now
before us:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The following translation of the Sleeping
Bard,&rsquo; says Mr. Borrow, in his preface, &lsquo;has long
existed in manuscript.&nbsp; It was made by the writer of these
lines in the year 1830, at the request of a little Welsh
bookseller of his acquaintance, who resided in the rather
unfashionable neighbourhood of Smithfield, and who entertained an
opinion that a translation of the work of Elis Wyn would enjoy a
great sale, both in England and Wales.&nbsp; On the eve of
committing it to the press, however, the Cambrian Briton felt his
small heart give way within him: &ldquo;Were I to print
it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I should be ruined.&nbsp; The terrible
descriptions of vice and torment would frighten the genteel part
of the English public out of its wits, and I should to a
certainty be prosecuted by Sir James Scarlett.&nbsp; I am much
obliged to you for the trouble you have given yourself on my
account&mdash;but myn Diawl! I had no idea, till I had read him
in English, that Elis Wyn had been such a terrible
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet there is no harm in the book.&nbsp; It is true that
the author is anything but mincing in his expressions and
descriptions, but there is nothing in the Sleeping Bard which can
give offence to any but the over fastidious.&nbsp; There is a
great deal of squeamish nonsense in the world; let us hope,
however, that there is not so much as there was.&nbsp; Indeed,
can we doubt that such folly is on the decline, when we find
Albemarle Street in &lsquo;60 willing to publish a harmless but
plain-speaking book which Smithfield shrank from in
&rsquo;80?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The work is divided into three parts, devoted to three
separate and distinct visions, which the Bard pretends to have
seen at three different times in his sleep.&nbsp; In assuming the
title of &lsquo;Sleeping Bard&rsquo; Elis Wyn committed a kind of
plagiarism, as it originated with a certain poet who flourished
in the time of the Welsh princes, some nine hundred years before
he himself was born, and to this plagiarism he humorously alludes
in one of his visions.&nbsp; The visions are described in prose,
but each is followed by a piece of poetry containing a short
gloss or comment.&nbsp; The prose is graphic and vigorous, almost
beyond conception; the poetry wild and singular, each piece
composed in a particular measure.&nbsp; Of the measures, two are
quite original, to be found nowhere else.&nbsp; The first vision
is the Vision of the World.&nbsp; The object of the Bard is to
describe the follies, vices, and crimes of the human race, more
especially those of the natives of the British Isles.&nbsp; In
his sleep he imagines that he is carried away by fairies, and is
in danger of perishing owing to their malice, but is rescued by
an angel, who informs him that <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>he has been
sent by the Almighty with orders to give him a distinct view of
the world.&nbsp; The angel, after a little time, presents him
with a telescope, through which he sees a city of a monstrous
size, with thousands of cities and kingdoms within it; and the
great ocean, like a moat, around it; and other seas, like rivers,
intersecting it.</p>
<p>This city is, of course, the world.&nbsp; It is divided into
three magnificent streets.&nbsp; These streets are called
respectively the streets of Pride, Pleasure, and Lucre.&nbsp; In
the distance is a cross street, little and mean in comparison
with the others, but clean and neat, and on a higher foundation
than the other streets, running upwards towards the east, whilst
they all sink downwards towards the north.&nbsp; This street is
the street of True Religion.&nbsp; The angel conducts him down
the three principal streets, and procures him glances into the
inside of various houses.&nbsp; The following scene in a cellar
of what is called the street of Pleasure, goes far to show that
the pen of Elis Wyn, at low description, was not inferior to the
pencil of Hogarth:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;From thence we went to a place where we
heard a terrible noise, a medley of striking, jabbering, crying
and laughing, shooting and singing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
Bedlam, doubtless,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; By the time we entered
the den the brawling had ceased.&nbsp; Of the company, one was on
the ground insensible; another was in a yet more deplorable
condition; another was nodding over a hearthful of battered pots,
pieces of pipes, and oozings of ale.&nbsp; And what was all this,
upon inquiry, but a carousal of seven thirsty neighbours,&mdash;a
goldsmith, a pilot, a smith, a miner, a chimney-sweeper, a poet,
and a parson who had come to preach sobriety, and to exhibit in
himself what a disgusting thing drunkenness is!&nbsp; The origin
of the last squabble was a dispute which had arisen among them
about which of the seven loved a pipe and flagon best.&nbsp; The
poet had carried the day over all the rest, with the exception of
the parson, who, out of respect for his cloth, had the most
votes, being placed at the head of the jolly companions, the poet
singing:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O where are there seven beneath the sky<br />
Who with these seven for thirst can vie?<br />
But the best for good ale these seven among<br />
Are the jolly divine and the son of song.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After showing the Bard what is going on in the interior of the
houses of the various streets, and in the streets themselves, the
angel conducts him to the various churches of the City of
Perdition: to the temple of Paganism, to the mosque of the Turk,
and to the synagogue of the Jews; showing and explaining to him
what is going on within them.&nbsp; He then takes him to the
church of the Papists, which the angel calls, very properly,
&lsquo;the church which deceiveth nations.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some
frightful examples are given of the depravity and cruelty of
monks and friars.&nbsp; The dialogue between the confessor and
the portly female who had murdered her husband, who was a member
of the Church of England, is horrible, but quite in keeping with
the principles of Popery; also the discourse which the same
confessor holds with the young girl who had killed her child,
whose father was a member of the monastery to which the monk
belonged.&nbsp; From the Church of Rome they go to the Church of
England.&nbsp; It is lamentable to observe what an attached
minister of the Church of England describes as going on within
the walls of a Church of England temple a hundred and fifty years
ago.&nbsp; Would that the description could be called wholly
inapplicable at the present time!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whereupon he carried me to the gallery of
one of the churches in Wales, the people being in the midst of
the service, and lo! some were whispering, talking, and laughing,
some were looking upon the pretty women, others were examining
the dress of their neighbours from top to toe; some were pushing
themselves forward and snarling at one another about rank, some
were dozing, others were busily engaged in their devotions, but
many of these were playing a hypocritical part.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The angel finally conducts the Bard to the small cross street,
that of True Religion, where, of course, everything is widely
different from what is found in any of the other streets.&nbsp;
In that street there was no fear but of incensing the King, who
was ever more ready to forgive than be angry with his subjects,
and no sound but that of psalms of praise to the Almighty.</p>
<p>The second section is a Vision of Death in his palace
below.&nbsp; The author&rsquo;s aim in this vision is less
apparent than in the preceding one.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, he
wished to impress upon people&rsquo;s minds the awfulness of
dying in an unrepentant state, from the certainty, in that event,
of the human soul being forthwith cast headlong down the
precipice of destruction.&nbsp; The Bard is carried away by sleep
to chambers where some people are crying, others screaming, some
talking deliriously, some uttering blasphemies in a feeble tone,
others lying in great agony with all the signs of dying men, and
some yielding up the ghost after uttering &lsquo;a mighty
shout.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is then conducted to a kind of limbo or
Hades, where he meets with his prototype the Sleeping Bard of old
and two other Welsh poets, one of whom is Taliesin, who is
represented as watching the caldron of the witch Cridwen, even as
he watched it in his boyhood.&nbsp; From thence he is hurried to
the palace of Death, where he sees the King of Terrors swallowing
flesh and blood, who, after a time, places <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>himself on a
terrific throne, and proceeds to pass judgment on various
prisoners newly arrived.&nbsp; They are dealt with in an awful
but very summary manner.&nbsp; It is to be remarked that all the
souls introduced in this vision are those of bad people, with the
exception of those of the poets which the Bard meets in
limbo.&nbsp; A dark intimation, however, is given that there is
another court or palace, where Death presides under a far
different form, and where he pronounces judgment over the souls
of the good.&nbsp; There is much in this vision which it is very
difficult to understand.&nbsp; The gloss, or commentary, called
&lsquo;Death the Great,&rsquo; abounds with very fine poetry.</p>
<p>The last Vision, that of Hell, is the longest of the
three.&nbsp; The Bard is carried in his sleep by the same angel
who in his first vision had shown him the madness and vanity of
the world, to the regions of eternal horror and woe, where he
beholds the lost undergoing tortures proportionate to the crimes
which they had committed on earth.&nbsp; After wandering from
nook to nook, the Bard and his guide at last come to the court
before the palace of the hellish regions, where, amidst thousands
of horrible objects, the Bard perceives two feet of enormous
magnitude, reaching to the roof of the whole infernal firmament,
and inquires of his companion what those horrible things may be,
but is told to be quiet for the present, as on his return he will
obtain a full view of the monster to whom they belong, and is
then conducted into the palace of Lucifer, who is about to hold a
grand council.&nbsp; The Arch-Fiend is described as seated on a
burning throne in a vast hall, the roof of which is of glowing
steel.&nbsp; Around him are his potentates on thrones of fire,
and above his head is a huge fist, holding a very frightful
thunderbolt, towards which he occasionally casts uneasy
glances.&nbsp; In the midst of the palace is a gulf, of yet more
horrible and frightful aspect than hell itself, which is
continually opening and closing, and which, the angel says, is
the month of &lsquo;Unknown&rsquo; or extremest hell, to which
the devils and the damned are to be hurled for ever on the last
day.&nbsp; The council is held in order to devise measures for
the farther extension of the kingdom of Lucifer.&nbsp; The
Arch-Fiend, in a speech which he makes, boasts that three parts
of the world have already been brought to acknowledge his sway,
chiefly through the instrumentality of his three
daughters&mdash;Pleasure, Pride, and Lucre; and he hopes that
eventually the whole world will be brought to do the same.&nbsp;
He is particularly desirous that Britain should be subject to
him, and requests the advice of his counsellors as to the best
means to be employed in order to accomplish his wish.&nbsp;
Various infernal potentates then arise and give him their advice,
each of whom is a personification of some crime, vice, or
folly.&nbsp; The debate is frequently interrupted by the sound of
war; for, as the angel observes, there is continual war in
hell.&nbsp; There is at one time a terrible disturbance and
outbreak, arising from a dispute between the Papists, the
Mahometans, and the bloody-minded Roundheads, as to which has
done most service to the cause of hell,&mdash;the Koran, the
Creed of Rome, or the Solemn League and Covenant.&nbsp; Lucifer
is only able to quell this disturbance&mdash;during which Mahomet
and Pope Julius assault each other tooth and nail&mdash;by
causing his old picked soldiers, the champions of hell, to tear
the combatants from each other.&nbsp; Amidst interruptions like
these the debate proceeds.&nbsp; Each of the personified crimes
and vices in succession&mdash;amongst whom are Mammon, Pride,
Inconsiderateness, Wantonness, and the Demon of
<i>Tobacco</i>&mdash;offers to go to Britain and do his best to
further the views of his master.&nbsp; Lucifer, however, after
listening to them all and acknowledging the peculiar merit of
each, says that none of them is of sufficient power to be relied
upon in the present emergency, but that he has a darling friend,
who, with their co-operation, is equal to the enterprise.&nbsp;
The friend turns out to be Ease&mdash;pleasant Ease&mdash;on
whose merits he expatiates with great eloquence, and with whom he
requests them to co-operate.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go with her,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;and keep everybody in his sleep and his rest, in
prosperity and comfort, abundance and carelessness, and then you
will see the poor honest man, as soon as he shall drink of the
alluring cup of Ease, become a perverse, proud, untractable
churl; the industrious labourer change into a careless waggish
rattler; and every other person become just as you would desire
him . . . Follow her to Britain,&rsquo; he says in conclusion,
&lsquo;and be as obedient to her as to our own royal
Majesty&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Then comes the finale:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;At this moment the huge bolt was shaken,
and Lucifer and his chief counsellors were struck to the vortex
of extremest hell, and oh! how horrible it was to see the throat
of Unknown opening to receive them!&nbsp; &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
said the Angel, &ldquo;we will now return; but you have not seen
anything in comparison with the whole which is within the bounds
of Destruction, and if you had seen the whole, it is nothing to
the inexpressible misery which exists in Unknown, for it is not
possible to form an idea of the world in extremest
hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at that word the celestial messenger
snatched me up to the firmament of the accursed kingdom of
darkness by a way I had not seen, whence I obtained, from the
palace along all the firmament of the black and hot
<i>Destruction</i>, and the whole land of forgetfulness, even to
the walls of the city of Destruction, a <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>full view of
the accursed monster of a giantess, whose feet I had seen
before.&nbsp; I do not possess words to describe her
figure.&nbsp; But I can tell you that she was a triple-faced
giantess, having one very atrocious countenance turned towards
the heavens, barking, snorting, and vomiting accursed abomination
against the celestial King; another countenance, very fair,
towards the earth, to entice men to tarry in her shadow; and
another, the most frightful countenance of all, turned towards
Hell to torment it to all eternity.&nbsp; She is larger than the
entire earth, and is yet daily increasing, and a hundred times
more frightful than the whole of hell.&nbsp; She caused hell to
be made, and it is she who fills it with inhabitants.&nbsp; If
she were removed from hell, hell would become paradise; and if
she were removed from the earth, the little world would become
heaven; and if she were to go to heaven, she would change the
regions of bliss into utter hell.&nbsp; There is nothing in all
the universe, except herself, that God did not create.&nbsp; She
is the mother of the four female deceivers of the city of
Destruction; she is the mother of Death; she is the mother of
every evil and misery; and she has a fearful hold on every living
man: her name is Sin.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>He who escapes from her
hook</i>, <i>for ever blessed is he</i>,&rdquo; said the
angel.&nbsp; Thereupon he departed, and I could hear his voice
saying, &ldquo;<i>Write down what thou hast seen</i>, <i>and he
who shall read it carefully</i>, <i>shall never have reason to
repent</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above is an outline of the work of Elis Wyn&mdash;an
extraordinary work it is.&nbsp; In it there is a singular mixture
of the sublime and the coarse, of the terrible and ludicrous, of
religion and levity, of the styles of Milton, of Bunyan, and of
Quevedo.&nbsp; There is also much in it that is Welsh, and much
that may be said emphatically to belong to Elis Wyn alone.&nbsp;
The book is written in the purest Cambrian, and from the time of
its publication has enjoyed extensive popularity in Wales.&nbsp;
It is, however, said that the perusal of it has not unfrequently
driven people mad, especially those of a serious and religious
turn.&nbsp; The same thing is said in Spain of the &lsquo;Life of
Ignatius Loyola.&rsquo;&nbsp; Peter Williams, in
&lsquo;Lavengro,&rsquo; the Welsh preacher who was haunted with
the idea that he had committed the sin against the Holy Ghost, is
frequently mentioning the work of Elis Wyn.&nbsp; Amongst other
things, he says that he took particular delight in its
descriptions of the torments of hell.&nbsp; We have no doubt that
many an Englishman, of honest Welsh Peter&rsquo;s gloomy
temperament, when he reads the work in its present dress will
experience the same kind of fearful joy.</p>
<p>The translation is accompanied by notes explanatory of certain
passages of the original beyond the comprehension of the common
reader.&nbsp; These notes are good, as far as they go, but they
are not sufficiently numerous, as many passages relating to
ancient manners and customs&mdash;perfectly intelligible, no
doubt, to the translator&mdash;must, for want of proper notes,
remain dark and mysterious to his readers.&nbsp; In the Vision of
Hell, a devil, who returns from the world to which he has been
despatched, and who gives an account of his mission, says that he
had visited two young maidens in Wales who were engaged in
turning the shift.&nbsp; Not a few people&mdash;ladies, amongst
the rest&mdash;will be disposed to ask what is meant by turning
the shift.&nbsp; Mr. Borrow gives elsewhere the following
explanation: &lsquo;It was the custom in Britain in ancient times
for the young maiden who wished to see her future lover to sit up
by herself at Hallowmass Eve, wash out her smock, shift, or
chemise, call it which of the three you please, place it on a
linen-horse before the fire, and watch it whilst drying, leaving
the door of the room open, in the belief that exactly as the
clock began to strike twelve the future bridegroom would look in
at the door, and remain visible till the twelfth stroke had
ceased to sound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of the notes which Mr. Borrow has given, the most important is
certainly that which relates to Taliesin, who, in the Vision of
Death, is described as sitting in Hades, watching a caldron which
is hanging over a fire, and is continually going bubble,
bubble.&nbsp; We give it nearly entire:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Taliesin lived in the sixth century.&nbsp;
He was a foundling, discovered in his infancy lying in a coracle
on a salmon weir, in the domain of Elphin, a prince of North
Wales, who became his patron.&nbsp; During his life he arrogated
to himself a supernatural descent and understanding, and for at
least a thousand years after his death he was regarded by the
descendants of the ancient Britons as a prophet or something
more.&nbsp; The poems which he produced procured for him the
title of &ldquo;Bardic King.&rdquo;&nbsp; They display much that
is vigorous and original, but are disfigured by mysticism and
extravagant metaphor.&nbsp; When Elis Wyn represents him as
sitting by a cauldron in Hades, he alludes to a wild legend
concerning him, to the effect that he imbibed awen or poetical
genius whilst employed in watching &ldquo;the seething pot&rdquo;
of the sorceress Cridwen, which legend has much in common with
one of the Irish legends about Fin Macoul, which is itself nearly
identical with one in the Edda describing the manner in which
Sigurd Fafnisbane became possessed of supernatural
wisdom.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is curious enough that the legend about deriving wisdom
from <i>sucking the scalded finger</i> should be found in Wales,
Ireland, and Scandinavia.&nbsp; But so it is, and Mr. Borrow is
clearly entitled to the credit of having been the first to point
out to the world this remarkable fact.&nbsp; In his work called
the &lsquo;Romany Rye,&rsquo; published some years ago, a story
is related containing parts of the early history <!-- page
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>of
the Irish mythic hero Fion Mac Comhail, <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a> or Fin Mac Coul, in which there is an
account of his burning his thumb whilst smoothing the skin of a
fairy salmon which is broiling over a fire, and deriving
supernatural knowledge from thrusting his thumb into his mouth
and sucking it; and Mr. Borrow tells the relater of that legend,
his amusing acquaintance Murtagh, that the same tale is told in
the Edda of Sigurd, the Serpent-Killer, with the difference that
Sigurd burns his finger, not whilst superintending the broiling
of a salmon, but whilst roasting the heart of Fafnir, the
man-serpent, whom he had slain.</p>
<p>Here, in his note on Taliesin, he shows that the same thing in
substance is said of the ancient Welsh bard.&nbsp; Of the three
versions of the legend, the one of which Sigurd Fafnisbane is the
hero is probably the most original, and is decidedly the most
poetical.</p>

class="footnote">[21b]</a>&nbsp; Above we have given what we
believe to be a plain and fair history of Hu Gadarn; but it is
necessary to state, that after his death he was deified, and was
confounded with the Creator, the vivifying power and the sun, and
mixed up with all kinds of myths and legends.&nbsp; Many of the
professedly Christian Welsh bards when speaking of the Deity have
called Him Hu, and ascribed to the Creator the actions of the
creature.&nbsp; Their doing so, however, can cause us but little
surprise when we reflect that the bards down to a very late
period cherished a great many druidical and heathen notions, and
frequently comported themselves in a manner more becoming
heathens than Christian men.&nbsp; Of the confounding of what is
heavenly with what is earthly we have a remarkable instance in
the ode of Iolo Goch to the ploughman, four lines of which,
slightly modified, we have given above.&nbsp; In that ode the
ploughman is confounded with the Eternal, and the plough with the
rainbow:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The Mighty Hu who reigns for ever,<br />
Of mead and song to men the giver,<br />
The emperor of land and sea<br />
And of all things which living be,<br />
Did hold a plough with his good hand,<br />
Soon as the deluge left the land,<br />
To show to men, both strong and weak,<br />
The haughty hearted and the meek,<br />
There is no trade the heaven below<br />
So noble as to guide the plough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To the Deity under the name of Hu there are some lines by one
Rhys, a Welsh bard of the time of Queen Elizabeth, though they
are perhaps more applicable to the Universal Pan or Nature than
to the God of the Christians:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;If with small things we Hu compare,<br
/>
No smaller thing than Hu is there,<br />
Yet greatest of the great is He,<br />
Our Lord, our God of Mystery;<br />
How swift he moves! a lucid ray,<br />
A sunbeam wafts him on his way;<br />
He&rsquo;s great on land, and great on ocean,<br />
Of one more great I have no notion;<br />
I dread lest I should underrate<br />
This being, infinitely great.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oedd balch gwalch golchiad ei lain,<br

Oedd beilch gweilch gweled ei werin.&rsquo;</p>

alliteration of lch in the first line:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="footnote25b"></a><a href="#citation25b"
class="footnote">[25b]</a>&nbsp; Of this celebrated place we are
permitted to extract the following account from Mr.
Borrow&rsquo;s unpublished work, &lsquo;Celtic Bards, Chiefs, and
Kings&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;After wandering for many miles towards the
south, over a bleak moory country, you come to a place called
Ffair Rhos, or something similar, a miserable village consisting
of a few half-ruined cottages, situated on the top of a
hill.&nbsp; From the hill you look down on a wide valley of a
russet colour, along which a river runs towards the south.&nbsp;
The whole scene is cheerless; sullen hills are all around.&nbsp;
Descending the hill you enter a large village divided into two by
the river, which here runs from east to west, but presently takes
a turn.&nbsp; There is much mire in the street; immense swine lie
in the mire, who turn up their snouts at you as you pass.&nbsp;
Women in Welsh hats stand in the mire, along with men without any
hats at all, but with short pipes in their mouths.&nbsp; They are
talking together; as you pass, however, they hold their tongues,
the women leering contemptuously at you, the men glaring sullenly
at you, and causing tobacco-smoke to curl in your face.&nbsp; On
your taking off your hat, however, and inquiring the way to the
Monachlog, everybody is civil enough, and twenty voices tell you
the way to the monastery.&nbsp; You ask the name of the river:
&ldquo;The Teivi, Sir, the Teivi.&rdquo;&nbsp; The name of the
bridge: &ldquo;Pont y Rhyd Fendigaid&mdash;the Bridge of the
Blessed Ford, Sir!&rdquo;&nbsp; You cross the bridge of the
Blessed Ford, and presently leaving the main road you turn to the
east, by a dunghill, up a narrow lane, parallel with the
river.&nbsp; After proceeding a mile up the lane amidst trees and
copses, and crossing a little brook which runs into the Teivi,
out of which you drink, you see before you in the midst of a
field, in which are tombstones and broken ruins, a rustic-looking
church; a farmhouse is near it, in the garden of which stands the
framework of a large gateway.&nbsp; You cross over into the
churchyard, stand on a green mound and look about you.&nbsp; You
are now in the very midst of the Monachlog Ystrad Flur, the
celebrated monastery of Strata Florida, to which in old times
popish pilgrims from all parts of the world repaired.&nbsp; The
scene is solemn and impressive.&nbsp; On the north side of the
river a large bulky hill, called Bunk Pen Bannedd, looks down
upon the ruins and the church; and on the south side, some way
behind the farmhouse, is another hill which does the same.&nbsp;
Rugged mountains form the background of the valley to the east,
down from which comes murmuring the fleet but shallow
Teivi.&nbsp; Such is the scenery which surrounds what remains of
Strata Florida; those scanty broken ruins compose all that
remains of that celebrated monastery in which kings, saints, and
mitred abbots were buried, and in which, or in whose precincts,
was buried Dafydd ab Gwilym, the greatest genius of the Cimbric
race, and one of the first poets of the world.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote28"></a><a href="#citation28"
class="footnote">[28]</a>&nbsp; It must be mentioned, however, in
justice to Douglas, that in the autobiography of Dr. Carlyle,
lately published, we find that &lsquo;John Douglas, who has for
some time been Bishop of Salisbury, and who is one of the most
able and learned men on that bench, had at this time (1758, some
years after Gronwy had left him) but small preferment.&rsquo;</p>

Transactions of the Dublin Ossianic Society&mdash;a most
admirable institution&mdash;there is an account of the early life
of Fin ma Coul, in which the burnt finger is mentioned; but that
number did not appear till more than a year subsequent to the
publication of the &lsquo;Romany Rye,&rsquo; and contains not the
slightest allusion either to Fafnisbane, <i>i.e.</i> the slayer
of Fafnir, or Taliesin&mdash;to the Eddacal or the Cumric
legend.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
